B00tme Live Disk Creator
=============
An attempt at making a simple and intuitive bootdisk creator that just _works._

**Currently, there is no working version yet! This notice will be removed once I made a working release.**

There are many bootdisk creators out there.
But in my experience, they all lack one thing or another.
So I wanted to create one that combines the best of all worlds, and thus, B00tme was born.

Features:
* Makes CDs, DVDs and USB sticks. (Focus lies with USB sticks)
* Fetches a fresh list of disks to download, with a builtin search function to make finding what you need easier.
* Can use IMG, ISO and RAW files.
* Simple and intuitive interface
* No convoluted custom boot menus, it simply copies the raw image contents to the disk and therefore it'll use the native image's boot menu!
* More to come as it develops..

*Note: This project is written in C# .NET . 
Once this project works I'll try to make it cross platform, 
either with a rewrite in C++ or with mono, we'll see how it goes.*
